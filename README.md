## Lessons Learned
I learned about a lot about classes, OOP, and how to properly use the getter and setter methods. This also prepared me for the difficulties of creating a project on a time crunch.
During the process of building this project, I gained significant knowledge and experience in several key areas. Firstly, I deepened my understanding of classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. 
I learned how to design and implement classes effectively, utilizing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular and reusable code. Another valuable lesson I learned was how to navigate the challenges of working on a project under time constraints. 
As I progressed through the development process, I encountered various obstacles that required quick thinking and efficient problem-solving. This experience honed my ability to prioritize tasks, make effective design decisions, and manage my time effectively to meet project requirements. 
Overall, the project served as an excellent learning opportunity, providing insights into the practical application of classes, OOP principles, and the importance of getter and setter methods.
